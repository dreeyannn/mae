 Maybe it's the way you say my name
Maybe it's the way you play your game
But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you
But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you
And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine
'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile
Wishing on dandelions all of the time
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time
I think that you are the one for me
'Cause it gets so hard to breathe
When you're looking at me
I've never felt so alive and free
When you're looking at me
I've never felt so happy
And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine
'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile
Wishing on dandelions all of the time
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time
Dandelion, into the wind you go
Won't you let my darling know?
Dandelion, into the wind you go
Won't you let my darling know that?
I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile
Wishing on dandelions all of the time
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time
I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine.
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch on nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get
I want you to know that if I can't be close to you
I settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (more than life)
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow (woo)
I need more time but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get
I want you to know that if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life, yeah
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy (oh)
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life
Whoa
Na, na-na
More than life
Oh
So if I can't get close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
But I miss you more than life
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life

Go ahead and bark after dark, fallen star
I'm your one-call away
Motel halls, neon walls
When night falls I am your escape
When you lay alone, I ache
Something I wanted to feel

If you've been waiting for falling in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

Not anyone, you're the one
More than fun, you're the sanctuary
'Cause what you want is what I want, sincerity

Souls that dream alone lie awake
I'll give you something so real

If you've been waiting for falling in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

Hold me oh so close, 'cause you never know
Just how long our lives will be

If you've been waiting for falling in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need
You know me the best
You know my worst, see me hurt, but you don't judge
That, right there is the scariest feeling
Opening and closing up again
I've been hurt so I don't trust
Now here we are, staring at the ceiling
I've said those words before but it was a lie
And you deserve to hear them a thousand times
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close?
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
Isn't it amazing how almost every line on our hands align?
When your hand's in mine
It's like I'm whole again, isn't that a sign?
I should speak my mind
I've said those words before but it was a lie
And you deserve to hear them a thousand times
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close?
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say? (Woah, oh yeah)
When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind
When I close my eyes
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close?
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind (it's only you)
When I close my eyes
If all it is is eight letters
When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind (you)
When I close my eyes
If all it is is eight letters
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true, mm-hmm
Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-hmm
Do you read my interviews? Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passing through, was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to be cool about what I was telling you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable, ooh
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you (when I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (I'm happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-hmm
You called me again, drunk in your Benz
Driving home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wasting my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You make me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fucking sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
Don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line, 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fucking leave me alone
Summer after high school when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you I put those records on (whoa)
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
But in another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me (whoa)
'Cause now I pay the price
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
The one (the one)
The one (the one)
The one (the one)
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
Well, I will call you darlin' and everything will be okay
'Cause I know that I am yours and you are mine
Doesn't matter anyway
In the night, we'll take a walk, it's nothing funny
Just to talk
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
Well, I have called you darlin' and I'll say it again, again
So kiss me 'til I'm sorry, babe, that you are gone and I'm a mess
And I'll hurt you and you'll hurt me
And we'll say things we can't repeat
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
You need to know
We'll take it slow
I miss you so
We'll take it slow
It's hard to feel you slipping (You need to know)
Through my fingers are so numb (We'll take it slow)
And how was I supposed to know (I miss you so)
That you were not the one?
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
Oh darlin', darlin', baby, you're so very fine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la (until I make you mine)
La-la-la-la-la
'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile
Wishing on dandelions all of the time
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time luv u
